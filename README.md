# NutritionApp

The NutritionApp allows users to search a large database of food items found in supermarkets,
farmers markets, etc and keep track of their food intake in a food diary. Along with meal tracking, 
the app calculates the total calories for the day as well as tracks the users marcos. 


Users can also create a custom meal through searching for ingredients used in their meal. The custom meal 
can be added to the food diary or saved in their custom meals for later. The nutritional facts of the custom meal 
are calculated for the user based on the food items used in it.
